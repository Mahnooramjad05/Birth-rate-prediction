📊 Machine Learning & Time-Series Forecasting Dashboard

This project is an interactive Streamlit-based dashboard for exploring datasets, preprocessing, visualization, and applying time-series forecasting models.
It allows you to upload CSV data, select target features, preprocess using various scalers, visualize patterns, and train models like XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, ARIMA, and Prophet.

🚀 Features

File Upload
Upload any CSV file.
Preview dataset and statistical summary.

Feature Selection
Select target column and features for modeling.

Preprocessing
Apply scaling methods: Standard, MinMax, Robust, MaxAbs, Normalize.

Visualization
Multiple plot options: Scatter, Line, Box, Histogram, Heatmap.

Modeling
Train and evaluate time-series forecasting models:

    🔹 XGBoost
    🔹 LSTM
    🔹 GRU
    🔹 ARIMA
    🔹 Prophet
Adjustable lookback window and future forecast steps.
Displays evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score.

📊 Example Usage

1. Upload a time-series CSV file (e.g., containing timestamps and values).
2. Select the target variable.
3. Apply preprocessing/scaling if required.
4. Visualize correlations, distributions, or trends.
